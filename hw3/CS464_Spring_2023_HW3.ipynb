In short, inpainting is a process of filling in the missing parts of an image. You will be applying this task on the MNIST RGB dataset, which is created for this homework by processing a subset of the original [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) images. It contains RGB digit images from 0 to 1 colored in black, red, blue, or green. You can see a subset of the dataset below. The download link of the dataset is provided in the following parts.\n",
