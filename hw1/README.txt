During the implementation numpy and pandas packages were used:

	numpy -> 1.24.2
	pandas -> 1.5.3

I have created an environment on Anaconda, and included the .yml file
in the zipped folder. Below are the commands to run on Anaconda 
Powershell Prompt:

	conda env create -f environment.yml
	conda activate cs464_hw1
	python q3main.py

!! Please make sure that the .csv files and the .py file are
   in the same directory
