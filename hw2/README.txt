During the implementation numpy and pillow packages were used:

	numpy -> 1.24.2
	Pillow -> 9.5.0
	notebook -> 6.5.3
	python -> 3.11.2

I have created an environment on Anaconda, and included the .yml file
in the zipped folder. Below are the commands to run on Anaconda 
Powershell Prompt:

	cd the-path-to-homework-folder
	conda env create -f environment.yml
	conda activate 464_hw2
	jupyter notebook

Then open ml_hw2.ipynb in Jupyter notebook and run it.
You can change the path to the cat images by changing the "path" variable
on the top of the file.
